# Orbs Contract SDK

The Orbs smart contract SDK is a framework for building decentralized applications over the Orbs blockchain. These applications are made of smart contracts written in the [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29) programming language.

{% hint style="warning" %}
While the Orbs smart contract SDK is stable, it is still under development; there may be breaking changes.

Support for additional programming languages like JavaScript is under way, [contact us](https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-contract-sdk/blob/master/FeatureRequest@orbs.com) for more information.
